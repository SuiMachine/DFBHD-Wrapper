# DFBHD-Wrapper
Wrapper for Delta Force: Black Hawk Down to make it easy to run the game in widescreen mode, based on [ThirteenAG's D3D8 wrapper](https://github.com/ThirteenAG/d3d8-wrapper).

# List of features
* Resolution override (replaces 1280x1024 resolution)
* FPS Limiter
* FOV Customisation (based on Hor+ FOV scaling)

# Known issues
* Doesn't work with Steam version as its exe is encrypted. Need to find a workaround to hook it just after it gets loaded fully into memory.
